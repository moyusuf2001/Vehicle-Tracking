# Vehicle-Tracking
This project implements object tracking in videos using OpenCV and YOLO-based object detection. It processes video frames, detects objects, assigns unique IDs for each object, and tracks their movement across frames. The output is saved as a new video file with bounding boxes and tracking information.
